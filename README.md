## Introduction:

### Project Description:

We will be creating an application to manage a client's investment between Ethereum and an account denominated in USD that represents an investment fund. This application will allow the user to transfer funds between accounts annd see the fees associated with the transfer and currency conversion, then to execute a transfer if desired. The application will then transfer the amount beteen the options as selected. The application utilizes Python and Solidity to execute the transfer via smart contract while allowing the user to have a clean interface with Streamlit.

### Project Objective:

We will be create an application that utilizes Python and Solidity to execute a transfer between two accounts, one being an Ethereum account and one an account denominated in USD that represents an inivestment fund, via smart contract while allowing the user to have a clean interface with Streamlit.

### User Stories:

As a client, I want a clean and easy to understand interface.

As a client, I want to know the fees associated with a transfer of my money between different assets before I initiate the transfer.

As a financial manager, I want to save time and money by automating the transfer of my client's assets so an employee can utilize their time more effectively.
